<h1>Child Roland To the Dark Tower Came</h1>
<h2>By Robert Browning</h2>

<p>
I.<br />
My first thought was, he lied in every word,<br />
That hoary cripple, with malicious eye<br />
Askance to watch the working of his lie<br />
On mine, and mouth scarce able to afford<br />
Suppression of the glee that pursed and scored<br />
Its edge, at one more victim gained thereby.</p>


<p>
II.<br />
What else should he be set for, with his staff?<br />
What, save to waylay with his lies, ensnare<br />
All travellers who might find him posted there,<br />
And ask the road? I guessed what skull-like laugh<br />
Would break, what crutch 'gin write my epitaph<br />
For pastime in the dusty thoroughfare,</p>

<p>
III.<br />
If at his counsel I should turn aside<br />
Into that ominous tract which, all agree,<br />
Hides the Dark Tower. Yet acquiescingly<br />
I did turn as he pointed: neither pride<br />
Nor hope rekindling at the end descried,<br />
So much as gladness that some end might be.</p>

<p>
IV.<br />
For, what with my whole world-wide wandering,<br />
What with my search drawn out thro' years, my hope<br />
Dwindled into a ghost not fit to cope<br />
With that obstreperous joy success would bring,—<br />
I hardly tried now to rebuke the spring<br />
My heart made, finding failure in its scope.</p>

<p>
V.<br />
As when a sick man very near to death<br />
Seems dead indeed, and feels begin and end<br />
The tears and takes the farewell of each friend,<br />
And hears one bid the other go, draw breath<br />
Freelier outside ('since all is o'er,' he saith,<br />
'And the blow fallen no grieving can amend;'),</p>

<p>
VI.<br />
While some discuss if near the other graves<br />
Be room enough for this, and when a day<br />
Suits best for carrying the corpse away,<br />
With care about the banners, scarves and staves,<br />
And still the man hears all, and only craves<br />
He may not shame such tender love and stay.</p>

<p>
VII.<br />
Thus, I had so long suffered in this quest,<br />
Heard failure prophesied so oft, been writ<br />
So many times among 'The Band'—to wit,<br />
The knights who to the Dark Tower's search addressed<br />
Their steps—that just to fail as they, seemed best,<br />
And all the doubt was now—should I be fit?</p>

<p>
VIII.<br />
So, quiet as despair, I turned from him,<br />
That hateful cripple, out of his highway<br />
Into the path he pointed. All the day<br />
Had been a dreary one at best, and dim<br />
Was settling to its close, yet shot one grim<br />
Red leer to see the plain catch its estray.</p>

<p>
IX.<br />
For mark! no sooner was I fairly found<br />
Pledged to the plain, after a pace or two,<br />
Than, pausing to throw backward a last view<br />
O'er the safe road, 'twas gone; grey plain all round:<br />
Nothing but plain to the horizon's bound.<br />
I might go on; nought else remained to do.</p>

<p>
X.<br />
So, on I went. I think I never saw<br />
Such starved ignoble nature; nothing throve:<br />
For flowers—as well expect a cedar grove!<br />
But cockle, spurge, according to their law<br />
Might propagate their kind, with none to awe,<br />
You'd think; a burr had been a treasure trove.</p>
